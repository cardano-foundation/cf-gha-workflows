# Description

This action sets up a baseline for CF's engineering team GitHub Actions workflows. It includes the following features:

- Docker login to registries
- Sets common environment variables and github outputs so they can be leveraged by subsequent steps such as PR base branch, triggering branch, triggering tag, etc.
- Setup of typical workflow dependencies
- Provide a set of suggested docker image tags for the builds

# Usage

We recommend using these triggers as default as this action handles this workflow logic and provides docker tags for all the possible scenarios such as:

- PR artifacts
- Branch artifacts
- Release artifacts (main, tags)

```yaml
name: Example Workflow

    types: [ opened, synchronize ]
    branches-ignore: [ main ]
